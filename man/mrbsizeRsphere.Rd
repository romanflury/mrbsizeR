\title{Multiresolution analysis of random signals for spherical data.}
\usage{
mrbsizeRsphere(posteriorFile, mm, nn, lambdaSmoother, prob = 0.95,
  smoothOut = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{posteriorFile}{Matrix with posterior samples as column vectors.}

\item{mm}{Number of rows of the original object.}

\item{nn}{Number of columns of the original object.}

\item{lambdaSmoother}{Vector consisting of the smoothing levels to be used.}

\item{prob}{Credibility level for the posterior credibility analysis.}

\item{smoothOut}{Should the differences of smooths at neighboring scales be
returned as output (FALSE by default)?}
}
\value{
A list containing the following sublists:

\code{smMean} Posterior mean of all differences of smooths created.

\code{hpout} Pointwise (PW) and highest pointwise (HPW) probabilities
of all differences of smooths created.

\code{ciout} Simultaneous credible intervals (CI) of all differences of
smooths created.

\code{smoothSamples} Samples of differences of smooths at neighboring scales,
as column vectors.
}
\description{
\code{mrbsizeRSphere} is the interface of the scale space multiresolution method
for spherical data. Here, the differences of smooths as well as the posterior
credibility analysis are computed. The output can be analyzed with the plotting
functions \code{\link{plot.smMeanSphere}}, \code{\link{plot.CImapSphere}}
and \code{\link{plot.HPWmapSphere}}.
}
\details{
In contrast to \code{mrbsizeRgrid}, \code{mrbsizeRsphere} does not conduct
Bayesian signal reconstruction via sampling from a posterior distribution.
Samples of the posterior distribution have to be provided instead.

For further information and examples, see \code{\link{mrbsizeRgrid}} and
the vignette.
